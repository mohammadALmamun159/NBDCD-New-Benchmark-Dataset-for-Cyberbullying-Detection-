# NBDCD-New-Benchmark-Dataset-for-Cyberbullying-Detection-
This work revisited deep learning techniques in local Bangla dialects (Noakhali dialects) text and empirically compared their classification performance.
Very few works are done only in low-resource languages. However, there is no such work in Bangla, particularly in local Bangla dialects. In this work, we present a dataset that includes social media postings in the form of Noakhali dialects. We also use various deep learning techniques to offer an overview of this work along with details on our own dataset.
